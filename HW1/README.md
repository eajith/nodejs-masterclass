# nodejs-masterclass/hw1
The first homework assignment for the nodejs masterclass (from Pirple)

- start the server on default port with node index.js
- change port with environment variable :
    - on linux : PORT=XXXX node index.js
    - on windows : set PORT=XXXX & node index.js
- everything is 404 except for route "/hello/", which says one greeting or another.
